## Account Separation System

SmartWallet uses a dual-account system to help you better organize your finances:

### 🏦 Main Account (Long-term Savings & Reserves)
- **Purpose**: Stores your accumulated savings and reserves from previous months
- **Contains**: Historical balance, investment returns, debt payments received
- **Use Cases**: Emergency fund, long-term savings, investment capital
- **Visual**: Blue theme in the interface

### 💳 Current Account (Monthly Operations)  
- **Purpose**: Manages your current month's budget and day-to-day transactions
- **Contains**: This month's income, expenses, and daily transactions
- **Use Cases**: Monthly budget, regular expenses, income tracking
- **Visual**: Green theme in the interface

### 🔄 How Transfers Work

**Borrowing from Main Account:**
1. Click "Transfer to Current" on the Main Account card
2. Enter the amount you need
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Confirm the transfer
5. Money moves from Main → Current Account

**Repaying to Main Account:**
1. Click "Repay to Main" on the Current Account card
2. Enter the repayment amount
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Confirm the repayment
5. Money moves from Current → Main Account

**Month-End Rollover:**
1. Click "Rollover" on the Current Account card
2. If you have surplus: Automatically transfers to Main Account
3. If you have deficit: Borrows from Main Account to reset Current to $0
4. Prepares Current Account for the new month

### 📊 Transaction Categories

**Day-to-Day Transactions (Visible):**
- Regular income and expenses
- Transfers between Main and Current accounts
- Shows in your main transaction list

**Special Transactions (Hidden from daily view):**

### 💡 Best Practices
